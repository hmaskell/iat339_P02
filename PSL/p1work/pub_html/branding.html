    <p><em>What does the company do, or offer?</em></p>
    <p>RDL is a recreational adult dodgeball league. We play 10 weeks of dodgeball, with one day of playoffs.</p><br/>

    <p><em>Who is the company to potential customers? (as a person)</em></p>
    <p>RDL would be a fun way to meet new people through some sort of physical activity. Similarly to many other recreational leagues, there is a focus on community. It is a great league to get involved with Dodgeball in as it is not as competitive as its older brother, VDL.</p><br/>

    <p><em>Why might this company entice someone to purchase a product or service?</em></p>
    <p>It may not seem like it, but dodgeball is a real workout. Just like any sport, there is so much to learn, and everyone's gotta start somewhere. That being said, you might as well start in a league where you can meet cool people, and hone your skills until your wings fly, where you grow to be the strongest dodgeball player there ever was.</p>

    <p>Ellen (21, Female) just moved to Richmond this year for school and she is looking for a way to keep fit and get involved in her community. Since she doesn't know many people, she wants to find a way to make new friends without taking up too much of her study time. She comes across an RDL flyer at her university and decides to sign up as a single player after coming to a drop in night. She is placed on a team and plays with them every week.</p>
