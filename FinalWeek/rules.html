            <h3>Preamble</h3>
            <p>The Official Dodgeball Rules listed below have been constantly refined over the past 9 years to produce a style of dodgeball that is fast-paced, exciting, and fun. Feel free to use these dodgeball rules in your dodgeball activities. The Dodgeball Rules have a Creative Commons license, thus, please attribute the work properly. For the purpose of simplifying the language of the rules, all players, both male and female, will be represented with masculine pronouns.</p>

            <h3>Glossary</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Dead ball:</strong> A ball that hits an object, surface, or teammate before the player, or a ball declared as a dead ball by the referee.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Live ball:</strong> A ball that has been activated (see General Rules #5).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Match:</strong> A match is a series of games played against a team.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Trap:</strong> When a player makes a catch using another surface or object (ground, wall, teammate) (see Catch #6).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>In:</strong> Being eligible to participate in the game on court.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Out:</strong> Being ineligible to play in the game as a result of being hit, caught, or being out of bounds.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Opening Rush:</strong> When players approach the centerline to retrieve the balls at the signal of the referee (see General Rules #3).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Full Control:</strong> A player is in full control of a ball if he is able to release the ball in an obvious and deliberate action.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Reset:</strong> An attempt to stop the ball count in order to prolong possession (see Dead Ball #7). Any ball thrown at the other team, below 6FT, is considered fair play.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </figure>

            <h3>General Rules</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Maximum of 6 players and a minimum of 2 females (one of which must be from the team’s roster) on each team at the start of the game.
              </li>
              <li>
                6 standard IDA-approved balls (8.25” foam balls) are placed on the centerline in two groups of 3. Each group of 3 is placed at opposite ends of the centerline, in front of the referees.
              </li>
              <li>
                Opening Rush: Players must be touching the back wall at the start of the game. After the starting countdown of “3, 2, 1 Dodgeball!” teams approach the centerline to retrieve the balls (see Other Details #3).
              </li>
              <li>
                Teams can only take the 3 balls to their right initially (see Technical #2).
              </li>
              <li>
                Balls must touch the back wall before they are live. The ball is dead otherwise.
              </li>
              <li>
                Players attempt to eliminate opponents by hitting them with balls or catching their throws. If a player is hit with a live ball, that player is out.
              </li>
              <li>
                Eliminated players line up against the designated wall or on the sideline, which is to be announced at the start of the games, next to the referees, according to the order of elimination.
              </li>
              <li>
                Players are to play by the honour system. If in doubt, player should call themselves out. (see Officiating Guidelines – Main Responsibilities #6)
              <li>
                Play continues until one team is eliminated.
              </li>
              <li>
                Referee can pause the game at any point by saying, “Stop.” At that point, all events after and during are void.
                The game restarts with remaining players against their respective walls with ball possession retained, but all ball counts are restarted.
                All balls on the ground remain where they lay.
                Referees restart the game by a countdown of “3, 2, 1, Dodgeball!”

            <h3>League Policy</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Teams are co-ed, made up of a minimum of 6 players and maximum of 12 players.
              </li>
              <li>
                All players must sign a waiver, and be 19 years and over, in order to play; no exceptions.
              </li>
              <li>
                All teams must have 2 females, if not more, on the court to start a game. If needed, a team can borrow a female from another team, but must still have 1 player from their own roster for their games to officially count.
              </li>
              <li>
                Teams may borrow additional females in the regular season to a maximum of 5 players, excluding the female player from the original roster.
              </li>
              <li>
                In playoffs, no team may be allowed to borrow any females from another team.
              </li>
              <li>
                Substitutes that are outside of the league must sign a waiver prior to playing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Teams are not allowed to borrow male players from another team in the same division/night.
              </li>
              <li>
                Male substitute players can only play for one team per night.
              </li>
              <li>
                After 2 weeks of substitution for a certain team, a male substitute player will be ineligible to substitute for another team for the season.
              </li>
              <li>
                Illegal substitutes could result in a forfeit of all games played by the illegal substitute. An illegal substitute is a player that infringes General #6-9.
              </li>
              <li>
                Only roster players are eligible for Playoffs if they have played a minimum of 4 weeks prior to Playoffs. Exceptions will be granted on a case by case basis.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any physical altercations, or serious breaches of spirit and sportsmanship will be automatically met with disciplinary actions which could result in suspensions or expulsion.*
              </li>
              <li>
                Dangerous play – any type of play that is deemed dangerous or unsafe are highly discouraged. Any type of dangerous play will be subject to verbal warnings as well as expulsion. Please see Code of Conduct for more details.
              </li>
              <li>
                RDL has a zero tolerance policy towards drugs and alcohol. They are prohibited in all gyms and surrounding areas, and within players’ bodies (playing under the influence). Simply put, if a player or a RDL Exec can smell the substances emanating from a player, then the offender will be ejected from the premises immediately and will be subjected to further disciplinary action afterwords, including suspensions and expulsion.
              </li>
              <li>
                Usage of gym apparatuses during dodgeball play (chin-up bars, climbing walls, ropes) or performing dangerous actions and stunts (backflips off walls and the gym stage) are banned due to safety concerns.
              </li>
              <li>
                Captains’ handshake: to build trust, goodwill and a better sense of community, captains are to meet with each other at the beginning of the night, before any games are played, and take a minute to introduce themselves, shake hands, and wish each other well. This helps with any conflicts on the courts.
              </li>
              <li>
                Captains’ Clause: a game may be played under some variation of the rules and policies agreed upon by the captains of the teams involved.**
              </li>
              <li>
                RDL expects all players to be mature, respectful and sportsmanlike to other participants and to league organizers. In order to protect the community, we reserve the right to refuse service.
              </li>
              <li>
                If a shoe comes off a player during the course of a game, the game is immediately stopped and acts as a normal referee stoppage. Once the shoe has been put back on, the game will restart with all players back against the wall according to the League Rules.
              </li>
              <li>
                Head Injury: If a player experiences an action that results in a head injury, per basic concussion symptoms, that player will sit out the remainder of the evening. For said player to be approved to continue playing after the night of the injury, a doctor’s note sent to the league (info@rdldodgeball.ca) will be required.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>*NEW*</strong> Default (No Show) Teams who do not show up with no notice will be charged a default fine of $50. Teams who default will not be scheduled to play until the fee has been paid by their next scheduled date. Teams will not be charged if the night’s Division Director is notified at least 24 hours in advance.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              * – In order to protect league players, RDL reserves the right to give official warnings and suspensions on any of the above violations, and may ask the instigator to leave the court or premise immediately if the violation is severe. Three official warnings, or a single severe violation will lead to a ban from the league for the rest of the season including playoffs.
            </p>
            <p>
              ** – This rule is only for rare and extenuating circumstances (e.g. permitting a team to play with only 1 female on the court or 1 female substitute player at Playoffs due to unexpected injury or absence). Both captains must agree on any changes of the rules and policies. In addition, pressuring another captain to change the rules and policies against his/her will is unsportsmanlike.

            <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
            <p>Spirit is of utmost importance at RDL and unsportsmanlike conduct, spirit breaches, and actions detrimental to the league will not be tolerated. This includes:</p>
              <h4>

                Contested headshots do occur, and are considered accidental (to a degree) or reasonable due to the play:

                <li>

                <li>
                  The ball bounces off of something (ball/wall/ground/player) and hits a player in the head

                <li>
                  A person is throwing at another player and the recipient walks in front of the throw

                  The person lowers their head into the ball
