          <h3>Preamble</h3>
          <p>The Official Dodgeball Rules listed below have been constantly refined over the past 9 years to produce a style of dodgeball that is fast-paced, exciting, and fun. Feel free to use these dodgeball rules in your dodgeball activities. The Dodgeball Rules have a Creative Commons license, thus, please attribute the work properly. For the purpose of simplifying the language of the rules, all players, both male and female, will be represented with masculine pronouns.</p>

          <h3>Glossary</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Dead ball:</strong> A ball that hits an object, surface, or teammate before the player, or a ball declared as a dead ball by the referee.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Live ball:</strong> A ball that has been activated (see General Rules #5).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Match:</strong> A match is a series of games played against a team.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Trap:</strong> When a player makes a catch using another surface or object (ground, wall, teammate) (see Catch #6).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>In:</strong> Being eligible to participate in the game on court.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Out:</strong> Being ineligible to play in the game as a result of being hit, caught, or being out of bounds.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Opening Rush:</strong> When players approach the centerline to retrieve the balls at the signal of the referee (see General Rules #3).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Full Control:</strong> A player is in full control of a ball if he is able to release the ball in an obvious and deliberate action.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reset:</strong> An attempt to stop the ball count in order to prolong possession (see Dead Ball #7). Any ball thrown at the other team, below 6FT, is considered fair play.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </figure>

        <figure>
  <h3>General Rules</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Maximum of 6 players and a minimum of 2 females (one of which must be from the team’s roster) on each team at the start of the game.
    </li>
    <li>
      6 standard IDA-approved balls (8.25” foam balls) are placed on the centerline in two groups of 3. Each group of 3 is placed at opposite ends of the centerline, in front of the referees.
    </li>
    <li>
      Opening Rush: Players must be touching the back wall at the start of the game. After the starting countdown of “3, 2, 1 Dodgeball!” teams approach the centerline to retrieve the balls (see Other Details #3).
    </li>
    <li>
      Teams can only take the 3 balls to their right initially (see Technical #2).
    </li>
    <li>
      Balls must touch the back wall before they are live. The ball is dead otherwise.
    </li>
    <li>
      Players attempt to eliminate opponents by hitting them with balls or catching their throws. If a player is hit with a live ball, that player is out.
    </li>
    <li>
      Eliminated players line up against the designated wall or on the sideline, which is to be announced at the start of the games, next to the referees, according to the order of elimination.
    </li>
    <li>
      Players are to play by the honour system. If in doubt, player should call themselves out. (see Officiating Guidelines – Main Responsibilities #6)
    <li>
      Play continues until one team is eliminated.
    </li>
    <li>
      Referee can pause the game at any point by saying, “Stop.” At that point, all events after and during are void.
      The game restarts with remaining players against their respective walls with ball possession retained, but all ball counts are restarted.
      All balls on the ground remain where they lay.
      Referees restart the game by a countdown of “3, 2, 1, Dodgeball!”
    </li>
  </ol>
